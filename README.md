## Technology

The Work Year In Review is an application that generates a slideshow with Teams usage information for the past 180 days. 
The app allows users to click on the personal tab in Teams to retrieve usage information via a simple query against the 
Graph API. It then summarizes the data and presents it in a visually appealing HTML5 slideshow that can feature text, 
text over a picture, text over a video, and more. 

AI is used to generate visual artifacts for the slideshow as well as create text to present the information in a better way. 

The app aims to provide users with a fun and informative experience similar to that offered by Spotify, Strava, and other applications that provide periodic overviews of user activities.


The App was created using Razor components with the Teams Toolkit, and can be hosted on an Azure App Service.
